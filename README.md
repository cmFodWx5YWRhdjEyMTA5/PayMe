### The Proposed Level of Achievement: 

Apollo 11


### The Initial Motivation

You just had lunch / dinner with your friends or colleagues, and you offered to pay the bill. However, now the issue is that everyone ate a slightly different priced item(s), with some who have ate more than the rest, or in cases where some items are shared across your friends. 

Your friends want to pay you back but you find the nett calculation for each friend a chore, and instead suggests your friends to pay you back another time, or they can foot the bill the next time you guys eat out again. Time passes, and soon you forgot how your expenditure had increased. 


### The Aim

The aim of PayMe is to offer an easy experience for people to split bills so that they only pay for the items they have ate / bought. It offers to keep track of the amount you owe to other people, as well as the amount people owe you.

The current trend among consumers is to use PayLah! to request payment from friends and vice versa. As such, we have intended to incorporate PayLah! service in our app to make payment a breeze. In essence, we are an ‘all-in-one’ app that aims to resolve bill splitting through PayLah!.


### Target Audience

Payer (person who paid the bill)
Payee (person paying to someone else)
